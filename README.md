# Fast-Food-Order-Management
 A food ordering system for a fast food restaurant that serves burgers and Salads. The program takes the names                      
 of people ordering food and their choices and then wait until those in front of them have been served. 
 It is implemented by using a linked list data structure that maintains the name of the people, the number of items (number of burgers and salad order), and the in-restaurant status (whether the order is reserved or is waiting in the restaurant.
